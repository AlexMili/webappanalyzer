# webappanalyzer

This project is a continuation of the iconic [**Wappalyzer**](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) that went private recently.

First and foremost, Enthec is committed not to set this repo private at any moment since this would be out of the scope of the company's business.
 
Our interest is to keep it growing, so it can be helpful to the community as it has been until now.

There are no changes to be expected in the library. We will update it with the same JSON structure currently in use so the user experience will not be modified.
